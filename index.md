# Sustainable Landscapes Group Manual

## About

We are a research group that works on solutions for environmental sustainability mostly at landscape and larger scales based sat the University of Queensland. Our work is highly quantitative and multi-disciplinary and draws on the disciplines of landscape ecology, ecosystem service science, biodiversity conservation, decision science, and the social and economic sciences. We are mostly based in the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences ([SEES](https://sees.uq.edu.au/)) and are part of the Centre for Biodiversity and Conservation Science ([CBCS](https://cbcs.centre.uq.edu.au/)). We work collaboratively with a wide range of researchers from different disciplines within UQ, nationally, and internationally and with end-users of our research (particularly governments and NGOs).

#### RDM

UQ provides a collaborative, safe, and secure large-storage system called the [Research Data Manager](https://research.uq.edu.au/rmbt/uqrdm) (RDM). The RDM provides UQ with an integrated data management system covering the entire research data lifecycle. The RDM provides initial storage of 1-TB per project, with options to increase storage if needed. Students and staff can create as many projects in the RDM as needed. and can access these folders from the 'R' Drive on the UQ network.
