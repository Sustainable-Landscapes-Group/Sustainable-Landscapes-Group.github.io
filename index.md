# Sustainable Landscapes Group Manual

## About

We are a research group that works on solutions for environmental sustainability mostly at landscape and larger scales based sat the University of Queensland. Our work is highly quantitative and multi-disciplinary and draws on the disciplines of landscape ecology, ecosystem service science, biodiversity conservation, decision science, and the social and economic sciences. We are mostly based in the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences ([SEES](https://sees.uq.edu.au/)) and are part of the Centre for Biodiversity and Conservation Science ([CBCS](https://cbcs.centre.uq.edu.au/)). We work collaboratively with a wide range of researchers from different disciplines within UQ, nationally, and internationally and with end-users of our research (particularly governments and NGOs).

## Website

We have a group website (powered by [Wix](https://www.wix.com)) at [(https://www.sustainable-landscapes-group.com/](https://www.sustainable-landscapes-group.com/) where we list group members and post news and information about research, publications and opportunities. Each group member should have access to the website, have their profile represented, and be able to add blog post or edit other aspects of the website.
